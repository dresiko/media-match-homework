# Reporter Matching System

This document explains how the reporter matching algorithm works - from user input to ranked reporter list.

## 🎯 Overview

The system takes a story brief and user preferences, then finds the best-fit reporters using semantic search and intelligent ranking.

## 📊 How It Works

### Step 1: Gather User Inputs

The system collects:
- **Story Brief** (required): Full description of what you want to pitch (include angle, hook, key points)
- **Outlet Types**: National business/tech, trade, regional, newsletters, podcasts
- **Geography**: US only, US + EU/UK, global
- **Target Publications** (optional): Specific outlets to focus on
- **Competitors** (optional): Related companies/announcements for context

### Step 2: Build Enhanced Query

The `QueryService` prepares a semantic search query by:

1. **Repeating the story brief** (2x weight for importance)
2. **Including outlet type keywords** to guide search:
   - National business/tech → "technology business innovation enterprise startups"
   - Trade/specialist → "industry trade specialist vertical sector analysis"
   - Regional → "regional local community metro area"
   - Newsletters → "newsletter subscriber publication analysis"
   - Podcasts → "podcast audio interview discussion"

3. **Geographic context**
4. **Target publications**
5. **Competitor/related context**

**Example:**

```javascript
// User input:
{
  storyBrief: "Battery startup using domestically-sourced metallurgical silicon for EVs. Materials breakthrough for climate/EV sector strengthening US supply chain.",
  outletTypes: ["national-business-tech", "trade-specialist"],
  geography: ["US"]
}

// Enhanced query:
"Battery startup using domestically-sourced metallurgical silicon for EVs. Materials breakthrough for climate/EV sector strengthening US supply chain. 
Battery startup using domestically-sourced metallurgical silicon for EVs. Materials breakthrough for climate/EV sector strengthening US supply chain. 
technology business innovation enterprise startups industry trade specialist 
Geographic focus: US"
```

### Step 3: Generate Query Embedding

The query text is converted to a 768-dimensional vector using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`:

```javascript
const queryEmbedding = await embeddingsService.generateEmbeddings(queryText);
// Returns: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (768 numbers)
```

This embedding captures the **semantic meaning** of the story.

### Step 4: Search Similar Articles

The query embedding is compared against **ALL** article embeddings in S3 using **cosine similarity**:

```javascript
const similarArticles = await s3VectorService.searchSimilarArticles(
  queryEmbedding,
  limit * 3  // Get extra articles to find unique reporters
  // No filters! Let similarity do the ranking
);
```

**Why no filters?**
- User preferences (outlet types, geography) are already embedded in the query
- Hard filters would exclude potentially perfect matches
- A European reporter might cover US stories brilliantly
- Let semantic similarity be the judge

**Cosine Similarity** measures how similar two vectors are:
- 1.0 = identical
- 0.0 = unrelated
- Higher = more similar

### Step 5: Extract & Rank Reporters

From the similar articles, we:

1. **Group by reporter** (name + outlet combination)
2. **Aggregate their articles**:
   - Count relevant articles
   - Calculate average similarity score
   - Collect article details

3. **Rank by average similarity**:
   - Reporters who wrote multiple highly-relevant articles rank higher
   - Consistency matters more than single hits

4. **Generate justifications**:
   - Why this reporter is a good match
   - Link to specific articles as evidence

### Step 6: Return Ranked Results

```json
{
  "query": {
    "storyBrief": "...",
    "angle": "...",
    "outletTypes": ["national-business-tech"],
    "geography": ["US"],
    "keyTopics": ["battery", "silicon", "EV", "supply chain", "climate"]
  },
  "reporters": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "name": "Sarah Chen",
      "outlet": "TechCrunch",
      "matchScore": 89,
      "justification": "Wrote 3 highly relevant articles; Recently covered similar topics (5 days ago); Covers for TechCrunch",
      "recentArticles": [
        {
          "title": "Battery Startup Revolutionizes EV Supply Chain...",
          "url": "https://...",
          "publishedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
          "similarity": 0.92,
          "description": "..."
        }
      ],
      "totalRelevantArticles": 3,
      "email": null,
      "linkedin": null,
      "twitter": null
    }
  ],
  "totalArticlesAnalyzed": 45
}
```

## 🧮 Ranking Formula

Reporters are ranked by **average similarity score** across their articles:

```
Average Similarity = Sum of article similarities / Number of articles
```

**Why average instead of max?**
- Rewards consistent coverage of related topics
- Avoids one-hit wonders
- Identifies beat reporters vs. general assignment

**Example:**

Reporter A:
- Article 1: 0.95 similarity
- Article 2: 0.90 similarity
- **Average: 0.925** ⭐

Reporter B:
- Article 1: 0.98 similarity
- **Average: 0.98** ⭐⭐

Reporter B ranks higher despite fewer articles because they wrote THE most relevant piece.

## 🔍 Key Components

### QueryService (`query.service.js`)

**Main Methods:**

1. **`prepareQueryText(userInput)`**
   - Combines user inputs into enhanced search query
   - Adds contextual keywords for outlet types
   - Returns weighted query string

2. **`generateQueryEmbedding(userInput)`**
   - Creates query embedding from user inputs
   - Uses OpenAI embedding model
   - Returns 768-dimensional vector

3. **`extractKeyTopics(storyBrief)`**
   - Identifies main topics for display
   - Helps users understand what we're searching for
   - Returns array of keywords

4. **`buildSearchFilters(userInput)`**
   - Converts preferences into search filters
   - Geography, outlet types, publications
   - Returns filter object

### Reporters Route (`routes/reporters.js`)

**Main Functions:**

1. **`extractReportersFromArticles(articles, limit)`**
   - Groups articles by reporter
   - Calculates aggregate statistics
   - Sorts by average similarity
   - Returns top N reporters

2. **`generateJustification(reporter)`**
   - Creates human-readable explanation
   - Links to evidence (articles)
   - Explains why this is a good match

## 💡 Why This Approach Works

### Semantic Search > Keyword Search

**Traditional keyword approach:**
- "battery" matches articles about phone batteries, car batteries, battery litigation
- Misses articles about "energy storage" or "power cells"
- No understanding of context

**Semantic embedding approach:**
- Understands "domestically-sourced metallurgical silicon for EVs" means:
  - Clean energy / climate tech
  - Manufacturing / supply chain
  - Electric vehicles
  - Materials innovation
- Finds articles even if they don't use exact words
- Captures meaning and context

### Outlet Type Context (Soft Guidance, Not Hard Filters)

Adding keywords like "technology business innovation" when user selects "national business/tech" helps the search naturally favor:
- Articles from business/tech outlets
- Coverage with business/innovation angle
- Business-focused reporters

But it doesn't exclude other matches! If a lifestyle reporter wrote an amazing piece on your topic, they'll still appear - just ranked lower by similarity.

### Story Brief Weight

Repeating the story brief gives it 2x weight in the embedding, ensuring the core topic dominates the search even with all the additional context.

**Best Practice:** Include everything important in the story brief itself - the angle, hook, key benefits, and context. OpenAI's embedding model will understand it all.

### No Hard Filters = Better Results

We intentionally don't filter out articles by:
- Geography - A London-based reporter might cover Silicon Valley
- Outlet type - A podcast host might also write articles
- Publication - The best match might be from an unexpected source

The query embedding naturally biases toward your preferences, but leaves room for surprises!
