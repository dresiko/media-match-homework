# Optional Questions Update 📝

## What Changed

Transformed the optional questions section from a **single embedded form** to **two separate chat prompts** with text input at the bottom.

## Before

**Step 4:** One combined form
```
🤖 Got it! Would you like to add any optional details? 
   (You can skip this)
   
   [Embedded form with two fields:]
   [Target publications input field]
   [Competitors input field]
   
   [Skip] [Submit]
```

## After

**Step 4:** Target Publications
```
🤖 Perfect! Are there any specific publications I should 
   focus on finding best-fit contacts at? 
   (You can skip this by leaving it blank)

[Text input at bottom]
📝 e.g., TechCrunch, The Information, WSJ (or leave blank to skip)
[Submit]
```

**Step 5:** Competitors Context
```
🤖 Got it! Are there any competitors or other announcements 
   I should consider when running your search?

[Text input at bottom]  
📝 e.g., Similar to Stripe's AWS partnership announcement (or leave blank to skip)
[Submit]
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. More Conversational ✅
- Follows the same pattern as Story Brief (Step 1)
- One question at a time feels more natural
- Less overwhelming than a form with multiple fields

### 2. Matches Homework Proposal ✅
Uses the exact wording from the assignment:
> "Are there any specific publications I should focus on finding best-fit contacts at? Are there any competitors or other announcements I should consider when running your search?"

### 3. Better UX ✅
- **Consistent input pattern** - All text questions use bottom input
- **Clear skip instructions** - "leave blank to skip"
- **Visual consistency** - Same UI for all text-based questions
- **Better mobile** - Easier to type in bottom input than embedded fields

### 4. Flexible Skipping ✅
- Can leave blank to skip
- No separate "Skip" button needed
- Shows "(Skipped)" in message history
- Natural flow continues either way

## Flow Comparison

### New Step Numbering

| Step | What Happens | Input Type |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Story Brief | Bottom text input |
| 2 | Outlet Types | Embedded buttons |
| 3 | Geography | Embedded buttons |
| 4 | Target Publications (optional) | Bottom text input |
| 5 | Competitors (optional) | Bottom text input |
| 6 | Loading/Searching | Typing indicator |
| 7 | Results | Full results view |

### Pattern Consistency

**Text Questions (bottom input):**
- Step 1: Story Brief
- Step 4: Publications
- Step 5: Competitors

**Multiple Choice (embedded buttons):**
- Step 2: Outlet Types
- Step 3: Geography

**This creates a clear pattern!** ✨

## Technical Changes

### App.js Updates

1. **Split handler function:**
```javascript
// Before
handleOptionalSubmit(skip)

// After  
handlePublicationsSubmit()  // Step 4
handleCompetitorsSubmit()   // Step 5
```

2. **Added step 5 to input visibility:**
```javascript
{(currentStep === 1 || currentStep === 4 || currentStep === 5) && (
  <div className="chat-input-container">
    ...
  </div>
)}
```

3. **Dynamic placeholders:**
```javascript
placeholder={
  currentStep === 1 
    ? "Tell me about your story..."
    : currentStep === 4
    ? "e.g., TechCrunch, The Information, WSJ (or leave blank to skip)"
    : "e.g., Similar to Stripe's AWS partnership (or leave blank to skip)"
}
```

4. **Updated step numbering:**
   - Results view: `currentStep === 7` (was 6)
   - Loading state: `currentStep === 6` (was 5)

### Message Flow

**Publications (Step 4):**
```javascript
if (inputValue.trim()) {
  addMessage('user', inputValue);
  formData.targetPublications = inputValue;
} else {
  addMessage('user', '(Skipped)');
}
```

**Competitors (Step 5):**
```javascript
if (inputValue.trim()) {
  addMessage('user', inputValue);
  formData.competitors = inputValue;
} else {
  addMessage('user', '(Skipped)');
}
```
