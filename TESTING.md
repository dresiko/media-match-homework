## üîç Backend Verification

### API Endpoint Test

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/reporters/match \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "storyBrief": "Battery startup using domestically-sourced silicon for EVs",
    "outletTypes": ["national-tech-business"],
    "geography": ["us"],
    "limit": 15
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- 200 OK

  "twitter": "@danmilmo"
}
```

### All Reporters Test

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reporters/all
```

**Expected Response:**
- 200 OK
- 38 reporters with complete contact info

## üêõ Common Issues

### Backend won't start
- Check `.env` file exists with all required vars
- Ensure AWS credentials are valid
- Verify OpenAI API key is set

### Frontend can't connect
- Confirm backend is running on port 3001
- Check CORS is enabled
- Create `.env` in frontend with `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001`

### No results returned
- Ensure articles are seeded: `cd api && yarn seed`
- Check S3 bucket has articles indexed
- Verify embeddings were generated

### Justifications are generic
- OpenAI API key must be valid
- Check API quota hasn't been exceeded
- Fallback to rule-based if API fails (this is expected behavior)

## üìä Performance Benchmarks
